# CalcApp

A small test app intended to be a first foray into C#

## Getting Started

This is a small test app using visual studio 2017. You will need to install and run VS2017 in order to run and use the app.

## Features

You can enter two numbers that will be minipulated in one of four ways. Add, Multiply, Divide, and Subtract.

## Resources and Links

I leveraged Stack overflow and the 7.0 in a nutshell publication.
